Only way to get pass this screen is to close the app and restart it. I see other people are experiencing the same behavior. Seems like this got passed QA somehow. Not terribly impressed with the app. Please fix this ASAP or I‚Äôll have to move on to alternatives.",

Another way to put it is that it‚Äôs a visual representation of your brains activity when attempting to focus on a task or a visual representation of the brain during meditation. I really like the feedback and the ability to compare past sessions to current. It took about a week or so before I really started noticing small improvements in focus and I do mean small subtle but effective improvements. With patience and consistency I feel strongly that this device will really help with my focus, anxiety, stress and sleep. It‚Äôs going to take time and I won‚Äôt develop some cool super powers but I am finally able to train my brain and see/feel the improvements.",

    "review": "I see more and more little improvements in myself the longer I use it. Like, I am more willing to get things done that I dislike doing around the house or with my budget. I am becoming more focused at work. I notice I am getting better at not being triggered at some things and I am recovering quicker at the things that do still get me. I have been using it for about a month now. The other day I was hit with hard information and I was actually able to say, I am done worrying about this tonight and chose to go to sleep and actually slept without my mind racing all night or preventing me from going to sleep. That was huge. I also am noticing more when I am being critical towards other. Like it is bringing awareness to me so I can change it. I think it will also help me change it the more I use it. I catch myself breathing more through stressful moments helping them be less stressful. This thing is a miracle that come in a box. It is so easy to use and I have my whole family using it. Thank you mendi!! I have done neurofeedback before to help with a head injury. I am so grateful for the price of this vs that, and the convenience of having it be in the home or wherever I want to do it. Thank you thank you thank you! Using this device is literally helping my marriage get better!! Bit by bit as we both use it. Those reading this, you have to give it the time and consistency but it is such an easy thing to do. I do miss a day or two a week and still get amazing results so you dont have to be perfect but it is sooo worth the little effort it takes to do it!",

    "review": "But the app could use some minor improvements. The overall activity snapshot at the end could have neural activity numbers going up the side of the graph making it more accurate for showing how a session actually looked for brain activity. That way those graphs would show something more real. A graph that only shows time along the bottom and nothing going up the side is not a reflection of the actual data. Also if the Mendi app could show battery life of the headband that would greatly improve frustration when the headband lights up as if it should work but the app doesn't connect.  I have also had to turn off my phone to reset the app which gets glitchy from time to time.  Lastly the performance, commitment, and activity circles on the top what are they actually showing? I understand commitment but the other two are vague in what they are relating to.   Otherwise I love the Mendi and will continue to use it as it is helping me understand what affects my mental cognition ‚ù£Ô∏è",

    "review": "I‚Äôm a medically retired firefighter/medic with diagnosed ADHD, PTSD, general anxiety, and depression.  I underwent treatments including EMDR, hypnotherapy, CBT, and DBT.  I was prescribed alpha stimulation to help manage nightmares, irrational fears, suicidal ideations, and sleep deprivation (essentially shock therapy).  I have learned that meditation and exercise historically helped me the most.  Then Mendi came screaming across feed. I bought in because of a rudimentary familiarity with brain function in a PTSD brain (with skepticism). \n\nUltimately, I love this tool and am finding myself meditating with it more than without it.  I love seeing how my sessions are monitored.  I also feel more relaxed after my sessions.  I had my 10th session over the last two weeks today and I can visualize how my focus is improving.\n\nI can‚Äôt confirm Mendi is responsible for helping me quit chewing, but my curbed desire for alcohol and nicotine appear to have a correlation with the use of Mendi. I am far less interested in stimulants than I have been in a long time.  \n\nI am recommending this tool for further investigation from my union to aid in first responder mental health training and treatments.",

The explanation on the website is filled with vague hedges. Basically, it says your score doesn‚Äôt matter as much as your improvement. But it doesn‚Äôt even quantify what a good improvement would be. While I understand a ‚Äúgood‚Äù score might vary widely depending on age and preexisting health conditions (adhd, depression,‚Ä¶ etc),  and lifestyle (exercise, diet, substance use/abuse, etc.), it would be great if they could present us with some averages and means( baselines based on age and categories people self identify they are trying to improve). They must have a significant amount of data at this point, and the fact that they are not willing to share this data does not instill me with confidence.",

The app has a lot of great articles and videos to help the user understand neuro feedback, the Mendi device, and how our sleep, diet, and exercise affect our brain health. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is interested in exploring brain health.

    "review": "If nothing else, this device helps you train your positive thinking muscles and to let go and overcome your negative thinking patterns! When the ball starts to fall, your negative thinking really kicks in and this is a great tool to help notice when it does and to try different thoughts out. I‚Äôve been using mendi for about one year now and I am convinced my day turns out better when I use mendi. Typically use it once a day for a 10min session. Using it is almost like an active meditation in that you seem to do better with a light concentration rather than willful concentration. When I try to ‚Äúwill‚Äù the ball up, it doesn‚Äôt seem to work to well. But when I focus on a specific spot on my body and relax my breathing, it seems to rise better. I dont know why that is or if it is unique to me. \nBut I like using mendi, and I like the ‚ÄúJourneys ‚Äú section they added. Winnerminds has some good meditations to go along with mendi. \nI recommend anyone getting it.",

I think you could have better on boarding baked into the sessions when you start, I had to seek out how the positive reinforcement actually works and its explained in day 4 of a video series, but that info should be drip fed through the first few sessions because it helps you immensely.\n\nAfter I started trying to ‚Äúfeel happy‚Äù when ball goes up, and ‚Äúfeel bad‚Äù when ball goes down, thats what trains the subconscious to prefer better blood flow.\n\nThat part was missed, and took me 2 weeks to figure out as I was poking around and playing with the app.\n\nMy gf asked how does it work?

I really like that the app is free and several people can use the same device without having to pay any additional fees for subscriptions. At first I was spotty with my Mendi practice but as I have become more consistent I have noticed greater improvement with my overall scores. Beyond the scores, I am an adult male with ADHD and have found that my mood has improved as well as my ability to focus on everyday tasks. I would recommend the Mendi for anyone who has a desire to improve their mental health. I would love to see Mendi introduce more games so there is a variety in the brain training. It would also be  cool to see more statistics to track improvement over time.",

    "review": "There is no variation to the training. So even just after a few days of using it, it gets boring and I zone out. Also, I was just doing a session and somebody in the background started talking about what the mendi score is toward the of it and then the app froze and the 10+ minutes of training did not complete and got stuck on ‚Äúloading‚Äù. Also, I am considering getting a refund because the device doesn‚Äôt seem to get a correct signal from my head half the time so then you see tremendous falls of 20-30% without me being able to do anything about it‚Ä¶ until the sensors catch a signal again. I think this product is simply not ready for customers. The sensors/ system need to be better and the app as well needs debugging and much more variety to the training to keep the customer engaged.

    "review": "I got the Mendi about 10 days ago and I‚Äôve been using it every day. I‚Äôm still figuring out how to control the ball - clearly that requires some mental experimentation. I believe I‚Äôve made progress and almost all days, my assessment of the session matches, qualitatively, my Mendi score. There were some surprises tho. On my first session this afternoon, I was thinking about something stressful at work and became very agitated. I looked at the ball and, during that time, it was gyrating wildly, going steeply up for a little bit and then falling steeply into the depths. It was like the ball was riding needles up and down! I fully expected my Mendi session to have a low score, but to my surprise, I got my highest score ever at 90 and my highest ever area under the graph! That was puzzling and a little disturbing because I did not expect, or want, my scores to be high when I was agitated and my frontal lobe completely out of my conscious control! Not sure if this is an actionable item but i wanted to put it out there in the hope that it‚Äôs a useful tidbit. Couple fixes and changes I‚Äôd like: Id like to be able to see all my numbers and plots for a session even if it isn‚Äôt the best session of the day. Right now it only gives you hints of what your numbers could be by showing you part of each number, with no way of clicking on them and seeing them fully! The second is that the app has frozen on me a couple of times after using it, when I try to scroll up and down.",

I have a couple issues and suggestions:\n\nI dislike the chime tone. It reminds me of casinos and I end up turning my volume all the way off to avoid it. A variety of tones to choose from or the option to turn off the chimes while still having the music would be great.\nThe visual display that comes up after a session rarely displays the Mendi score at this point. I have the most recent update. I usually receive a message instead to do a session or swipe to see my history. I can still see the individual metrics below, but the inconsistency and not knowing how to compare with previous results makes me less enthusiastic to use the app and has led to gaps in training. It seems to post the results twice, actually now that I look at it again, but the date is inaccurate. I trained today but not yesterday, however today‚Äôs results are displayed with both yesterday‚Äôs and today‚Äôs dates, yesterday having the visual Mendi score and today having the message to do a session or swipe left",

    "review": "Update:  I contacted support and was told that the delays on some screens was due to backend server load issues that are being addressed. This does seem to explain the issues I am/was seeing:\n\n1) Initial screen when starting a session - the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù for selecting me vs a guest is slow to fill in with my name and let me start a session. \n\n2) ‚ÄúRotate to landscape‚Äù prompt is slow to respond after rotation and then load the start of a session. \n\n3) The end of a session appears hung, but does eventually load the concluding screens of a session. \n\nIt would seem to make sense to display some sort of animation at these junctures that shows the user that the app is still running, and not broken. Perhaps some sort of background asynchronous communication/loading could also make the app appear more responsive. \n\nAll told, I‚Äôm happy with the app and the Mendi headband device. I hope more customization of the session experience will be added in the future. \n\nIt would be nice to have additional choices of background music, to play your own music, or turn off music. It might be nice to have a more beautiful background than the current sky/color gradient, such as actual natural imagery: sky, forest, or a coastal landscape. I wonder if some other changing focus image other than the spinning ball, like a fountain/jet of water, a point or sphere of light, or perhaps something purely aural - a fluctuating sound such a variable frequency filter over brown/white/pink noise. \n\nI‚Äôm still working with the system and look forward to getting better at using it, and hope the user experience will be improved/made more customizable. \n\n============\nThe Mendi app seems to be working well, but at the end of a training session the app hangs on a blank (colored, but no UI) screen. I need to go to the iOS app switcher, swipe it away, and restart it. The app shows that my session activity is recorded, but this clearly isn‚Äôt a good user experience. I‚Äôm doing a 10 minute session, running iOS 15.5, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 256 GB storage. The Mendi app version is v1.19.0.2205101542.

Having only been three days, it‚Äôs too soon to boast about any improvements, but I am certain I am feeling something going on in my head. Having read about the benefits of neuro-feedback in the book, ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps The Score,‚Äù by Bessel Van der Kolk MD, I am excited by the possibilities of the benefits of consistent daily practice with Mendi.
