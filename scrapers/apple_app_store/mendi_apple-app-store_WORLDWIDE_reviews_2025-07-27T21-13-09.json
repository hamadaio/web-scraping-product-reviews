Only way to get pass this screen is to close the app and restart it. I see other people are experiencing the same behavior. Seems like this got passed QA somehow. Not terribly impressed with the app. Please fix this ASAP or I‚Äôll have to move on to alternatives.",

Another way to put it is that it‚Äôs a visual representation of your brains activity when attempting to focus on a task or a visual representation of the brain during meditation. I really like the feedback and the ability to compare past sessions to current. It took about a week or so before I really started noticing small improvements in focus and I do mean small subtle but effective improvements. With patience and consistency I feel strongly that this device will really help with my focus, anxiety, stress and sleep. It‚Äôs going to take time and I won‚Äôt develop some cool super powers but I am finally able to train my brain and see/feel the improvements.",

    "review": "I see more and more little improvements in myself the longer I use it. Like, I am more willing to get things done that I dislike doing around the house or with my budget. I am becoming more focused at work. I notice I am getting better at not being triggered at some things and I am recovering quicker at the things that do still get me. I have been using it for about a month now. The other day I was hit with hard information and I was actually able to say, I am done worrying about this tonight and chose to go to sleep and actually slept without my mind racing all night or preventing me from going to sleep. That was huge. I also am noticing more when I am being critical towards other. Like it is bringing awareness to me so I can change it. I think it will also help me change it the more I use it. I catch myself breathing more through stressful moments helping them be less stressful. This thing is a miracle that come in a box. It is so easy to use and I have my whole family using it. Thank you mendi!! I have done neurofeedback before to help with a head injury. I am so grateful for the price of this vs that, and the convenience of having it be in the home or wherever I want to do it. Thank you thank you thank you! Using this device is literally helping my marriage get better!! Bit by bit as we both use it. Those reading this, you have to give it the time and consistency but it is such an easy thing to do. I do miss a day or two a week and still get amazing results so you dont have to be perfect but it is sooo worth the little effort it takes to do it!",

    "review": "But the app could use some minor improvements. The overall activity snapshot at the end could have neural activity numbers going up the side of the graph making it more accurate for showing how a session actually looked for brain activity. That way those graphs would show something more real. A graph that only shows time along the bottom and nothing going up the side is not a reflection of the actual data. Also if the Mendi app could show battery life of the headband that would greatly improve frustration when the headband lights up as if it should work but the app doesn't connect.  I have also had to turn off my phone to reset the app which gets glitchy from time to time.  Lastly the performance, commitment, and activity circles on the top what are they actually showing? I understand commitment but the other two are vague in what they are relating to.   Otherwise I love the Mendi and will continue to use it as it is helping me understand what affects my mental cognition ‚ù£Ô∏è",

    "review": "I‚Äôm a medically retired firefighter/medic with diagnosed ADHD, PTSD, general anxiety, and depression.  I underwent treatments including EMDR, hypnotherapy, CBT, and DBT.  I was prescribed alpha stimulation to help manage nightmares, irrational fears, suicidal ideations, and sleep deprivation (essentially shock therapy).  I have learned that meditation and exercise historically helped me the most.  Then Mendi came screaming across feed. I bought in because of a rudimentary familiarity with brain function in a PTSD brain (with skepticism). \n\nUltimately, I love this tool and am finding myself meditating with it more than without it.  I love seeing how my sessions are monitored.  I also feel more relaxed after my sessions.  I had my 10th session over the last two weeks today and I can visualize how my focus is improving.\n\nI can‚Äôt confirm Mendi is responsible for helping me quit chewing, but my curbed desire for alcohol and nicotine appear to have a correlation with the use of Mendi. I am far less interested in stimulants than I have been in a long time.  \n\nI am recommending this tool for further investigation from my union to aid in first responder mental health training and treatments.",

Mendi helps you creating and staying in that gap, so that you can take more conscious decisions. \nA quick example: I had been biting my nails for basically all my life. Then I started training with Mendi. I know recognise the triggers and completely stopped biting my nails. I still bring my fingers close to my mouth at times, but then I‚Äôm in that gap and I take the conscious decision to don‚Äôt do it.\n\nIt‚Äôd be nice to see if the guys at mendi can create some new games to play with the headband.",

While I understand a ‚Äúgood‚Äù score might vary widely depending on age and preexisting health conditions (adhd, depression,‚Ä¶ etc),  and lifestyle (exercise, diet, substance use/abuse, etc.), it would be great if they could present us with some averages and means( baselines based on age and categories people self identify they are trying to improve).

I notice little things all the time that are without a doubt improvements. Everything is better, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot better. I love to play golf. Doing a 10 minute Mendi session before golfing produces a mental focus that maintains itself throughout my entire round, which I love. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Mendi.",

    "review": "In the summer of 2023, I suffered a concussion. I had severe vertigo, headaches, limited mental bandwidth and my emotional regulation, which had been above average, deteriorated to almost non-existent within weeks. I realized I needed to take action to aid my recovery.\n\nAfter extensive research, I decided Mendi was the most suitable brain training device for my rehab. I purchased the device about 9-10 months after the injury, just before this last summer.\n\nAlthough I haven‚Äôt been as disciplined as I‚Äôd like, my scores have improved, and my ability to focus has increased significantly. Not only has Mendi helped me return to baseline, but it has also enhanced my emotional regulation beyond what it was before the concussion.\n\nI can quantify this improvement because I used to experience significant fear while rock climbing outdoors‚Äîa reasonable physiological response. This past summer, while I did feel some fear, it was about 20% as intense. Even in the most extreme situations, I was able to dial it back and recompose myself. In many cases, I felt no fear at all, which was a completely new experience for me since I started climbing.\n\nI‚Äôm surprised this app doesn‚Äôt have more reviews. Mendi is a game changer. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for this product and would love to see more gamification features to encourage consistent training.",

The second session I had poor scores in all these areas. So the score really only measures commitment to the app which is unhelpful for neurofeedback and brain training.",

More blood and oxygen going to your brain, how can you go wrong? Notice significantly less anxiety and nightmares while sleeping. Was able to sit and read a book for the first time in a while. It has been about a month of using. Really appreciate these inventors and their company & their commitment to keep it low cost.",

It really helps get the most out of meditation. \n\nI would love to see a few extra features on the app to help track progress like graphing of performance score, general score, peak neural activation, max control periods, total and average sessions times, etc all mapped over varying time periods. It would really bring this app to the next level for me.\n\nAt the moment, tracking performance is awkward and you can only look at a single session at a time and can‚Äôt see that progress over time.\n\nSome more creative and limited time badges, even monthly ones would be a nice addition too but not as important and the graphing.",

    "review": "If nothing else, this device helps you train your positive thinking muscles and to let go and overcome your negative thinking patterns! When the ball starts to fall, your negative thinking really kicks in and this is a great tool to help notice when it does and to try different thoughts out. I‚Äôve been using mendi for about one year now and I am convinced my day turns out better when I use mendi. Typically use it once a day for a 10min session. Using it is almost like an active meditation in that you seem to do better with a light concentration rather than willful concentration. When I try to ‚Äúwill‚Äù the ball up, it doesn‚Äôt seem to work to well. But when I focus on a specific spot on my body and relax my breathing, it seems to rise better. I dont know why that is or if it is unique to me. \nBut I like using mendi, and I like the ‚ÄúJourneys ‚Äú section they added. Winnerminds has some good meditations to go along with mendi. \nI recommend anyone getting it.",

I really like that the app is free and several people can use the same device without having to pay any additional fees for subscriptions. At first I was spotty with my Mendi practice but as I have become more consistent I have noticed greater improvement with my overall scores. Beyond the scores, I am an adult male with ADHD and have found that my mood has improved as well as my ability to focus on everyday tasks. I would recommend the Mendi for anyone who has a desire to improve their mental health. I would love to see Mendi introduce more games so there is a variety in the brain training. It would also be  cool to see more statistics to track improvement over time.",

I believe I‚Äôve made progress and almost all days, my assessment of the session matches, qualitatively, my Mendi score. There were some surprises tho. On my first session this afternoon, I was thinking about something stressful at work and became very agitated. I looked at the ball and, during that time, it was gyrating wildly, going steeply up for a little bit and then falling steeply into the depths. It was like the ball was riding needles up and down! I fully expected my Mendi session to have a low score, but to my surprise, I got my highest score ever at 90 and my highest ever area under the graph! That was puzzling and a little disturbing because I did not expect, or want, my scores to be high when I was agitated and my frontal lobe completely out of my conscious control! Not sure if this is an actionable item but i wanted to put it out there in the hope that it‚Äôs a useful tidbit. Couple fixes and changes I‚Äôd like: Id like to be able to see all my numbers and plots for a session even if it isn‚Äôt the best session of the day. Right now it only gives you hints of what your numbers could be by showing you part of each number, with no way of clicking on them and seeing them fully! The second is that the app has frozen on me a couple of times after using it, when I try to scroll up and down.",

I have a couple issues and suggestions:\n\nI dislike the chime tone. It reminds me of casinos and I end up turning my volume all the way off to avoid it. A variety of tones to choose from or the option to turn off the chimes while still having the music would be great.\nThe visual display that comes up after a session rarely displays the Mendi score at this point. I have the most recent update. I usually receive a message instead to do a session or swipe to see my history. I can still see the individual metrics below, but the inconsistency and not knowing how to compare with previous results makes me less enthusiastic to use the app and has led to gaps in training. It seems to post the results twice, actually now that I look at it again, but the date is inaccurate. I trained today but not yesterday, however today‚Äôs results are displayed with both yesterday‚Äôs and today‚Äôs dates, yesterday having the visual Mendi score and today having the message to do a session or swipe left",

    "review": "Update:  I contacted support and was told that the delays on some screens was due to backend server load issues that are being addressed. This does seem to explain the issues I am/was seeing:\n\n1) Initial screen when starting a session - the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù for selecting me vs a guest is slow to fill in with my name and let me start a session. \n\n2) ‚ÄúRotate to landscape‚Äù prompt is slow to respond after rotation and then load the start of a session. \n\n3) The end of a session appears hung, but does eventually load the concluding screens of a session. \n\nIt would seem to make sense to display some sort of animation at these junctures that shows the user that the app is still running, and not broken. Perhaps some sort of background asynchronous communication/loading could also make the app appear more responsive. \n\nAll told, I‚Äôm happy with the app and the Mendi headband device. I hope more customization of the session experience will be added in the future. \n\nIt would be nice to have additional choices of background music, to play your own music, or turn off music. It might be nice to have a more beautiful background than the current sky/color gradient, such as actual natural imagery: sky, forest, or a coastal landscape. I wonder if some other changing focus image other than the spinning ball, like a fountain/jet of water, a point or sphere of light, or perhaps something purely aural - a fluctuating sound such a variable frequency filter over brown/white/pink noise. \n\nI‚Äôm still working with the system and look forward to getting better at using it, and hope the user experience will be improved/made more customizable. \n\n============\nThe Mendi app seems to be working well, but at the end of a training session the app hangs on a blank (colored, but no UI) screen. I need to go to the iOS app switcher, swipe it away, and restart it. The app shows that my session activity is recorded, but this clearly isn‚Äôt a good user experience. I‚Äôm doing a 10 minute session, running iOS 15.5, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 256 GB storage. The Mendi app version is v1.19.0.2205101542.

    "review": "My Mendi was delivered on Wednesday, July 7, 2021. Arrived it perfect condition, well packaged, beautifully made, and was a snap to setup. It took seconds for it to locate and connect with the free app. In fact, it took longer to download the app than it took to setup and begin using.  Entire process is incredibly intuitive. Having only been three days, it‚Äôs too soon to boast about any improvements, but I am certain I am feeling something going on in my head. Having read about the benefits of neuro-feedback in the book, ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps The Score,‚Äù by Bessel Van der Kolk MD, I am excited by the possibilities of the benefits of consistent daily practice with Mendi. I have high hopes for this device and its training.",
