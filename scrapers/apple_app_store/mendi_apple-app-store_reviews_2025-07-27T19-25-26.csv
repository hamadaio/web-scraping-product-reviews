The other day I was hit with hard information and I was actually able to say, I am done worrying about this tonight and chose to go to sleep and actually slept without my mind racing all night or preventing me from going to sleep. That was huge. I also am noticing more when I am being critical towards other. Like it is bringing awareness to me so I can change it. I think it will also help me change it the more I use it. I catch myself breathing more through stressful moments helping them be less stressful. This thing is a miracle that come in a box. It is so easy to use and I have my whole family using it. Thank you mendi!! I have done neurofeedback before to help with a head injury. I am so grateful for the price of this vs that, and the convenience of having it be in the home or wherever I want to do it. Thank you thank you thank you!

The overall activity snapshot at the end could have neural activity numbers going up the side of the graph making it more accurate for showing how a session actually looked for brain activity. That way those graphs would show something more real. A graph that only shows time along the bottom and nothing going up the side is not a reflection of the actual data. Also if the Mendi app could show battery life of the headband that would greatly improve frustration when the headband lights up as if it should work but the app doesn't connect.  I have also had to turn off my phone to reset the app which gets glitchy from time to time.  Lastly the performance, commitment, and activity circles on the top what are they actually showing?

I underwent treatments including EMDR, hypnotherapy, CBT, and DBT.  I was prescribed alpha stimulation to help manage nightmares, irrational fears, suicidal ideations, and sleep deprivation (essentially shock therapy).  I have learned that meditation and exercise historically helped me the most.  Then Mendi came screaming across feed. I bought in because of a rudimentary familiarity with brain function in a PTSD brain (with skepticism). 

Ultimately, I love this tool and am finding myself meditating with it more than without it.  I love seeing how my sessions are monitored.  I also feel more relaxed after my sessions.  I had my 10th session over the last two weeks today and I can visualize how my focus is improving.

I can‚Äôt confirm Mendi is responsible for helping me quit chewing, but my curbed desire for alcohol and nicotine appear to have a correlation with the use of Mendi. I am far less interested in stimulants than I have been in a long time.

While I understand a ‚Äúgood‚Äù score might vary widely depending on age and preexisting health conditions (adhd, depression,‚Ä¶ etc),  and lifestyle (exercise, diet, substance use/abuse, etc.), it would be great if they could present us with some averages and means( baselines based on age and categories people self identify they are trying to improve).

I‚Äôm still figuring out how to control the ball - clearly that requires some mental experimentation. I believe I‚Äôve made progress and almost all days, my assessment of the session matches, qualitatively, my Mendi score. There were some surprises tho. On my first session this afternoon, I was thinking about something stressful at work and became very agitated. I looked at the ball and, during that time, it was gyrating wildly, going steeply up for a little bit and then falling steeply into the depths. It was like the ball was riding needles up and down! I fully expected my Mendi session to have a low score, but to my surprise, I got my highest score ever at 90 and my highest ever area under the graph! That was puzzling and a little disturbing because I did not expect, or want, my scores to be high when I was agitated and my frontal lobe completely out of my conscious control! Not sure if this is an actionable item but i wanted to put it out there in the hope that it‚Äôs a useful tidbit. Couple fixes and changes I‚Äôd like: Id like to be able to see all my numbers and plots for a session even if it isn‚Äôt the best session of the day. Right now it only gives you hints of what your numbers could be by showing you part of each number, with no way of clicking on them and seeing them fully! The second is that the app has frozen on me a couple of times after using it, when I try to scroll up and down.","1.24.0",""

I dislike the chime tone. It reminds me of casinos and I end up turning my volume all the way off to avoid it. A variety of tones to choose from or the option to turn off the chimes while still having the music would be great.
The visual display that comes up after a session rarely displays the Mendi score at this point. I have the most recent update. I usually receive a message instead to do a session or swipe to see my history. I can still see the individual metrics below, but the inconsistency and not knowing how to compare with previous results makes me less enthusiastic to use the app and has led to gaps in training. It seems to post the results twice, actually now that I look at it again, but the date is inaccurate. I trained today but not yesterday, however today‚Äôs results are displayed with both yesterday‚Äôs and today‚Äôs dates, yesterday having the visual Mendi score and today having the message to do a session or swipe left","1.22.0",""

"2022-05-24T14:36:31-07:00","MarqR","4","Apps works well, but it is slow to load some UI","Update:  I contacted support and was told that the delays on some screens was due to backend server load issues that are being addressed. This does seem to explain the issues I am/was seeing:

1) Initial screen when starting a session - the ‚Äúbutton‚Äù for selecting me vs a guest is slow to fill in with my name and let me start a session. 

2) ‚ÄúRotate to landscape‚Äù prompt is slow to respond after rotation and then load the start of a session. 

3) The end of a session appears hung, but does eventually load the concluding screens of a session. 

It would seem to make sense to display some sort of animation at these junctures that shows the user that the app is still running, and not broken. Perhaps some sort of background asynchronous communication/loading could also make the app appear more responsive. 

All told, I‚Äôm happy with the app and the Mendi headband device. I hope more customization of the session experience will be added in the future. 

It would be nice to have additional choices of background music, to play your own music, or turn off music. It might be nice to have a more beautiful background than the current sky/color gradient, such as actual natural imagery: sky, forest, or a coastal landscape. I wonder if some other changing focus image other than the spinning ball, like a fountain/jet of water, a point or sphere of light, or perhaps something purely aural - a fluctuating sound such a variable frequency filter over brown/white/pink noise. 

I‚Äôm still working with the system and look forward to getting better at using it, and hope the user experience will be improved/made more customizable. 

============
The Mendi app seems to be working well, but at the end of a training session the app hangs on a blank (colored, but no UI) screen. I need to go to the iOS app switcher, swipe it away, and restart it. The app shows that my session activity is recorded, but this clearly isn‚Äôt a good user experience. I‚Äôm doing a 10 minute session, running iOS 15.5, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 256 GB storage.

The device works well and I like it so far, very easy to use with a awesome design. 

However, the app has issues with the login page, I need to login several times to get in, it also takes a long time loading to get your results after a session. 

I hope they can fix this soon!","1.19.0",""

Have to click buttons multiple times to get to training session (get dropped back several times). Just completed a training session and after finishing it just go back to starting a new one without recording results. Apart from that there is the problem that the measurement method constantly seems to change. Whenever I I think I get a hold of how to control the ball, the criteria seem to change with a software update and I am starting from square zero again. Very inconsistent and frustrating. Almost ready to give up on the device.","1.19.0",""

Does It Work? You betcha. Best meditations of my life. You so won‚Äôt be sorry if you buy a Mendi. 

If used regularly, you will wonder how you ever lived without this tool. I almost purchased a different kind of BCI. I chose MENDI (Best decision). In time, I‚Äôm sure I will try other products but I‚Äôm confident MENDI will always be my go to for my main practice. I suffer from ADHD and severe anxiety which means the typical medications. Been on them for years yet I‚Äôve never felt as good as I do right now. 
I Love My MENDI

In February, the one preceding the original March pandemic madness, I lost my mother to cancer. She was my mom, rock, and she was my best friend too. I‚Äôm 41 now and have not had a job for 15 years or drove a car in who knows. Up to last year I had never lived alone. I‚Äôd never lived outside of the house I grew up in. My entire life has been fighting my mental health issues. Now  I‚Äôm a child trying to learn how to live like an adult. It isn‚Äôt easy. I have practiced a lot over the years but never long-term habit before. I look forward to time using MEMDI Then I met MENDI.

 I LOVE MY MENDI. 

I thank everyone at MENDI for this product. I don‚Äôt know how I could ever express my gratitude. You guys saved my life. Anything I can do to help
you guys, I‚Äôd be honored. I‚Äôd be happy to take part in any beta testing, clinical studies, research studies, learning paths, whatever it be.
