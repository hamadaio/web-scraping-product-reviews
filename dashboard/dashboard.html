Only way to get pass this screen is to close the app and restart it. I see other people are experiencing the same behavior. Seems like this got passed QA somehow. Not terribly impressed with the app. Please fix this ASAP or I’ll have to move on to alternatives.</div>

Other areas like after a breathing session the text “breathing animation. well done” exposed instead of an animation

While the training session is good I’d really like new experiences that leverages the headset.</div>

                <div class="review-text">The device is super simple to use and It’s comfortable when snug on your forehead. The “game” is interesting because it’s a cool visual representation of my ability to focus. Another way to put it is that it’s a visual representation of your brains activity when attempting to focus on a task or a visual representation of the brain during meditation. I really like the feedback and the ability to compare past sessions to current. It took about a week or so before I really started noticing small improvements in focus and I do mean small subtle but effective improvements. With patience and consistency I feel strongly that this device will really help with my focus, anxiety, stress and sleep. It’s going to take time and I won’t develop some cool super powers but I am finally able to train my brain and see/feel the improvements.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I see more and more little improvements in myself the longer I use it. Like, I am more willing to get things done that I dislike doing around the house or with my budget. I am becoming more focused at work. I notice I am getting better at not being triggered at some things and I am recovering quicker at the things that do still get me. I have been using it for about a month now. The other day I was hit with hard information and I was actually able to say, I am done worrying about this tonight and chose to go to sleep and actually slept without my mind racing all night or preventing me from going to sleep. That was huge. I also am noticing more when I am being critical towards other. Like it is bringing awareness to me so I can change it. I think it will also help me change it the more I use it. I catch myself breathing more through stressful moments helping them be less stressful. This thing is a miracle that come in a box. It is so easy to use and I have my whole family using it. Thank you mendi!! I have done neurofeedback before to help with a head injury. I am so grateful for the price of this vs that, and the convenience of having it be in the home or wherever I want to do it. Thank you thank you thank you! Using this device is literally helping my marriage get better!! Bit by bit as we both use it. Those reading this, you have to give it the time and consistency but it is such an easy thing to do. I do miss a day or two a week and still get amazing results so you dont have to be perfect but it is sooo worth the little effort it takes to do it!</div>

                <div class="review-text">But the app could use some minor improvements. The overall activity snapshot at the end could have neural activity numbers going up the side of the graph making it more accurate for showing how a session actually looked for brain activity. That way those graphs would show something more real. A graph that only shows time along the bottom and nothing going up the side is not a reflection of the actual data. Also if the Mendi app could show battery life of the headband that would greatly improve frustration when the headband lights up as if it should work but the app doesn't connect.  I have also had to turn off my phone to reset the app which gets glitchy from time to time.  Lastly the performance, commitment, and activity circles on the top what are they actually showing? I understand commitment but the other two are vague in what they are relating to.   Otherwise I love the Mendi and will continue to use it as it is helping me understand what affects my mental cognition ❣️</div>

                <div class="review-text">I’m a medically retired firefighter/medic with diagnosed ADHD, PTSD, general anxiety, and depression.  I underwent treatments including EMDR, hypnotherapy, CBT, and DBT.  I was prescribed alpha stimulation to help manage nightmares, irrational fears, suicidal ideations, and sleep deprivation (essentially shock therapy).  I have learned that meditation and exercise historically helped me the most.  Then Mendi came screaming across feed. I bought in because of a rudimentary familiarity with brain function in a PTSD brain (with skepticism). 

Ultimately, I love this tool and am finding myself meditating with it more than without it.  I love seeing how my sessions are monitored.  I also feel more relaxed after my sessions.  I had my 10th session over the last two weeks today and I can visualize how my focus is improving.

I can’t confirm Mendi is responsible for helping me quit chewing, but my curbed desire for alcohol and nicotine appear to have a correlation with the use of Mendi. I am far less interested in stimulants than I have been in a long time.  

I am recommending this tool for further investigation from my union to aid in first responder mental health training and treatments.</div>

                <div class="review-text">This neuro feedback tool has definitely changed my life. The best way to put it is: between a stimulus and a response there’s a gap. Mendi helps you creating and staying in that gap, so that you can take more conscious decisions. 
A quick example: I had been biting my nails for basically all my life. Then I started training with Mendi. I know recognise the triggers and completely stopped biting my nails. I still bring my fingers close to my mouth at times, but then I’m in that gap and I take the conscious decision to don’t do it.

It’d be nice to see if the guys at mendi can create some new games to play with the headband.</div>

Mendi has helped me experience my thoughts in what I can only describe as a more manageable rather than hectic way. I can’t explain it, it’s like it’s easier to think and I don’t need as much energy to think. I love the breath work before each session because it helps me focus and prepare for my session so that I’m present and participating. It’s a comfortable device, easy to set up. I’m super curious to see how I do over a longer period of time and look forward to improving my brain health.</div>

However, I wish there were more information about the scores. The explanation on the website is filled with vague hedges. Basically, it says your score doesn’t matter as much as your improvement. But it doesn’t even quantify what a good improvement would be. While I understand a “good” score might vary widely depending on age and preexisting health conditions (adhd, depression,… etc),  and lifestyle (exercise, diet, substance use/abuse, etc.), it would be great if they could present us with some averages and means( baselines based on age and categories people self identify they are trying to improve). They must have a significant amount of data at this point, and the fact that they are not willing to share this data does not instill me with confidence.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I have had Mendi for more than 2 years now. Currently I’m on a 41 day streak. My mood, well-being, productivity, and many other aspects are better because of using Mendi. I notice little things all the time that are without a doubt improvements. Everything is better, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot better. I love to play golf. Doing a 10 minute Mendi session before golfing produces a mental focus that maintains itself throughout my entire round, which I love. I can’t say enough good things about Mendi.</div>

                <div class="review-text">In the summer of 2023, I suffered a concussion. I had severe vertigo, headaches, limited mental bandwidth and my emotional regulation, which had been above average, deteriorated to almost non-existent within weeks. I realized I needed to take action to aid my recovery.

After extensive research, I decided Mendi was the most suitable brain training device for my rehab. I purchased the device about 9-10 months after the injury, just before this last summer.

Although I haven’t been as disciplined as I’d like, my scores have improved, and my ability to focus has increased significantly. Not only has Mendi helped me return to baseline, but it has also enhanced my emotional regulation beyond what it was before the concussion.

I can quantify this improvement because I used to experience significant fear while rock climbing outdoors—a reasonable physiological response. This past summer, while I did feel some fear, it was about 20% as intense. Even in the most extreme situations, I was able to dial it back and recompose myself. In many cases, I felt no fear at all, which was a completely new experience for me since I started climbing.

I’m surprised this app doesn’t have more reviews. Mendi is a game changer. I’m incredibly grateful for this product and would love to see more gamification features to encourage consistent training.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Also liebe Leser,

ich finde im Nachhinein, dass ich mir zu viel von diesem Gerät/ App versprochen habe, aber es ist auf jeden Fall ein effektiver Weg sein ein eigenes Potenzial in Konzentration auszuschöpfen und zu trainieren. Die Übungen sind meiner Meinung nach mit vielen Messfehlern/ Rauschen verbunden. Leider gibt es für den Hausgebrauch, soweit ich weiß, keine bessere Alternative als Mendi mit fnirs Technologie. Den Umgang mit sich selbst bezogen auf das Gerät musste ich erstmal mühselig erlernen, wenn mans aber drauf hat, dann ist es allem in einem eine tolle Sache!</div>

                <div class="review-text">So it helped me get back to mindfulness. It has already helped me identify new pre-flow creative state triggers. However after few months of use it is no longer helpful.
I could get the same good score on two sessions. The first session I had high neutral activity, oxygen and focus. The second session I had poor scores in all these areas. So the score really only measures commitment to the app which is unhelpful for neurofeedback and brain training.</div>

The feedback provided by the app is really useful and is done in soothing way. I really like doing the activity and I believe it’s helping. Also, great job on the connectivity, the headband connects instantly without issue, which adds to the pleasure of using it.</div>

Never happened before, on this level. Do yourself a favour, get a Mendi, train your brain and so feed some more bloodflow through it - and watch what happends. So grateful!!!!
Edit. Have now done mendi training nearly every day since nov last year, and I feel more sharp than I have ever been.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I love the Mendi head band and doing the exercises. It really helps get the most out of meditation. 

I would love to see a few extra features on the app to help track progress like graphing of performance score, general score, peak neural activation, max control periods, total and average sessions times, etc all mapped over varying time periods. It would really bring this app to the next level for me.

At the moment, tracking performance is awkward and you can only look at a single session at a time and can’t see that progress over time.

Some more creative and limited time badges, even monthly ones would be a nice addition too but not as important and the graphing.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I do love the app and I feel the benefits from regular sessions.

However, I get disheartened when I lose my streak (it’s common for me to stay up past midnight, and the mendi is a part of my bedtime routine). Losing my streak sometimes makes it feel harder to start again from 0. 

Perhaps some sort of streak saver would work well for others like me, much like the ones that exist in other apps designed for daily practice.</div>

The app has a lot of great articles and videos to help the user understand neuro feedback, the Mendi device, and how our sleep, diet, and exercise affect our brain health. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is interested in exploring brain health. I’ve only been using the app for about a month, so I won’t know conclusively if it’s helping for another month or so, but I have seen a difference and a change in my ability to focus.</div>

Two things to improve on-
1-Maybe like put streak savers or smth to keep streaks
2- maybe one for iPad as well. Been doing this on my phone, but prefer if it was on my iPad 
That’s all, but it’s an amazing app!

                <div class="review-text">I suffer from major depression, anxiety and recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I bought this band hoping it could help alleviate some of the stuck feelings I have each and everyday. I believe Mendi has been a positive addition to my routine, especially if I can get myself to stick with it. It’s very easy to just try it out and start and I have had no major issues with it. So far so good! Thank you for creating something that is within reach, especially in the neurofeedback world! 

Some things I do wish is seeing more data related to what my brain or blood flow may be doing. I’m a very data oriented person so, any data for me to observe and utilize would be beneficial. Also health kit syncing would be awesome. I’d love to be able to give a result set to a Dr. or Psychologist!</div>

                <div class="review-text">Jag ser en utveckling i att det som tidigare triggade mig inte gör det lika intensivt längre. Det gör att jag får mer utrymme att omvärdera riktigt gamla sanningar om mig själv. Jag tänker att eftersom jag inte är lika investerad i att reagera i nutid möjliggör det en djupare bearbetning av gammalt missförhållanden som kommer upp till ytan. Alla borde ha en Mendi därför vi bär på sanningar om oss själv som vi hittade lösningar på utifrån en ännu inte utvecklad hjärna.

                <div class="review-text">If nothing else, this device helps you train your positive thinking muscles and to let go and overcome your negative thinking patterns! When the ball starts to fall, your negative thinking really kicks in and this is a great tool to help notice when it does and to try different thoughts out. I’ve been using mendi for about one year now and I am convinced my day turns out better when I use mendi. Typically use it once a day for a 10min session. Using it is almost like an active meditation in that you seem to do better with a light concentration rather than willful concentration. When I try to “will” the ball up, it doesn’t seem to work to well. But when I focus on a specific spot on my body and relax my breathing, it seems to rise better. I dont know why that is or if it is unique to me. 
But I like using mendi, and I like the “Journeys “ section they added. Winnerminds has some good meditations to go along with mendi. 
I recommend anyone getting it.</div>

                <div class="review-text">So cool that we have home devices like this now. I think you could have better on boarding baked into the sessions when you start, I had to seek out how the positive reinforcement actually works and its explained in day 4 of a video series, but that info should be drip fed through the first few sessions because it helps you immensely.

After I started trying to “feel happy” when ball goes up, and “feel bad” when ball goes down, thats what trains the subconscious to prefer better blood flow.

That part was missed, and took me 2 weeks to figure out as I was poking around and playing with the app.

My gf asked how does it work? I had no idea and couldn’t explain it to her… but now I can because I watched that video series.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Inwieweit Mendi tatsächlich das leisten kann, was die Werbung verspricht, kann ich nach zwei Wochen noch nicht beurteilen. Doch alleine die Tatsache, dass die App mich motiviert, jeden Tag zehn Minuten Zeit für mich zu nehmen und achtsam zu sein, macht Mendi lohnenswert. Und wenn dann später noch die erhöhte Konzentrationsleistung, Ausgeglichenheit und besserer Schlaf hinzu kommen, umso besser.</div>

                <div class="review-text">We got the Mendi almost a year ago during Black Friday, we got a $100 discount which was great. I really like that the app is free and several people can use the same device without having to pay any additional fees for subscriptions. At first I was spotty with my Mendi practice but as I have become more consistent I have noticed greater improvement with my overall scores. Beyond the scores, I am an adult male with ADHD and have found that my mood has improved as well as my ability to focus on everyday tasks. I would recommend the Mendi for anyone who has a desire to improve their mental health. I would love to see Mendi introduce more games so there is a variety in the brain training. It would also be  cool to see more statistics to track improvement over time.</div>

Since my dad had dementia, and I’ve been experiencing signs of it, I wanted to do everything I could to retrain my brain and give my brain the best opportunity of living out its best life for the remaining years that I have.

I’m still very new to Mendi, but I already feel a difference in how I sense  how I feel when my over analytical thinking mind begins to take over. 

Mendi is definitely my new friend for life and I look forward to many new journeys ahead!</div>

                <div class="review-text">There is no variation to the training. So even just after a few days of using it, it gets boring and I zone out. Also, I was just doing a session and somebody in the background started talking about what the mendi score is toward the of it and then the app froze and the 10+ minutes of training did not complete and got stuck on “loading”. Also, I am considering getting a refund because the device doesn’t seem to get a correct signal from my head half the time so then you see tremendous falls of 20-30% without me being able to do anything about it… until the sensors catch a signal again. I think this product is simply not ready for customers. The sensors/ system need to be better and the app as well needs debugging and much more variety to the training to keep the customer engaged. I am disappointed.</div>

Actually it gave better score when worn over the pillow. Customer service response was quick and full of explanations why it’s ok. Sorry, not buying it. My Garmin watch with optical sensor doesn’t read HR when removed from my wrist.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I got the Mendi about 10 days ago and I’ve been using it every day. I’m still figuring out how to control the ball - clearly that requires some mental experimentation. I believe I’ve made progress and almost all days, my assessment of the session matches, qualitatively, my Mendi score. There were some surprises tho. On my first session this afternoon, I was thinking about something stressful at work and became very agitated. I looked at the ball and, during that time, it was gyrating wildly, going steeply up for a little bit and then falling steeply into the depths. It was like the ball was riding needles up and down! I fully expected my Mendi session to have a low score, but to my surprise, I got my highest score ever at 90 and my highest ever area under the graph! That was puzzling and a little disturbing because I did not expect, or want, my scores to be high when I was agitated and my frontal lobe completely out of my conscious control! Not sure if this is an actionable item but i wanted to put it out there in the hope that it’s a useful tidbit. Couple fixes and changes I’d like: Id like to be able to see all my numbers and plots for a session even if it isn’t the best session of the day. Right now it only gives you hints of what your numbers could be by showing you part of each number, with no way of clicking on them and seeing them fully! The second is that the app has frozen on me a couple of times after using it, when I try to scroll up and down.</div>

It matters because the software is buggy. It registers the wrong day, doesn’t recognize that I’ve completed a session, and some of the scores appear random—the exact same scores on the three metrics but different scores overall. I want to be a fan and talk it up, but the customer service department has gone out of their way to make that impossible.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Hello! Thank you for your continued work on the app. I look forward to seeing it expand with more content and different games. I have a couple issues and suggestions:

I dislike the chime tone. It reminds me of casinos and I end up turning my volume all the way off to avoid it. A variety of tones to choose from or the option to turn off the chimes while still having the music would be great.
The visual display that comes up after a session rarely displays the Mendi score at this point. I have the most recent update. I usually receive a message instead to do a session or swipe to see my history. I can still see the individual metrics below, but the inconsistency and not knowing how to compare with previous results makes me less enthusiastic to use the app and has led to gaps in training. It seems to post the results twice, actually now that I look at it again, but the date is inaccurate. I trained today but not yesterday, however today’s results are displayed with both yesterday’s and today’s dates, yesterday having the visual Mendi score and today having the message to do a session or swipe left</div>

                <div class="review-text">Update:  I contacted support and was told that the delays on some screens was due to backend server load issues that are being addressed. This does seem to explain the issues I am/was seeing:

1) Initial screen when starting a session - the “button” for selecting me vs a guest is slow to fill in with my name and let me start a session. 

2) “Rotate to landscape” prompt is slow to respond after rotation and then load the start of a session. 

3) The end of a session appears hung, but does eventually load the concluding screens of a session. 

It would seem to make sense to display some sort of animation at these junctures that shows the user that the app is still running, and not broken. Perhaps some sort of background asynchronous communication/loading could also make the app appear more responsive. 

All told, I’m happy with the app and the Mendi headband device. I hope more customization of the session experience will be added in the future. 

It would be nice to have additional choices of background music, to play your own music, or turn off music. It might be nice to have a more beautiful background than the current sky/color gradient, such as actual natural imagery: sky, forest, or a coastal landscape. I wonder if some other changing focus image other than the spinning ball, like a fountain/jet of water, a point or sphere of light, or perhaps something purely aural - a fluctuating sound such a variable frequency filter over brown/white/pink noise. 

I’m still working with the system and look forward to getting better at using it, and hope the user experience will be improved/made more customizable. 

============
The Mendi app seems to be working well, but at the end of a training session the app hangs on a blank (colored, but no UI) screen. I need to go to the iOS app switcher, swipe it away, and restart it. The app shows that my session activity is recorded, but this clearly isn’t a good user experience. I’m doing a 10 minute session, running iOS 15.5, on an iPhone 13 Pro Max with 256 GB storage. The Mendi app version is v1.19.0.2205101542. Device model V4, Hardware version r2.1a-ty1, Firmware 1.0.2</div>

The device works well and I like it so far, very easy to use with a awesome design. 

However, the app has issues with the login page, I need to login several times to get in, it also takes a long time loading to get your results after a session. 

I hope they can fix this soon!</div>

Just completed a training session and after finishing it just go back to starting a new one without recording results. Apart from that there is the problem that the measurement method constantly seems to change. Whenever I I think I get a hold of how to control the ball, the criteria seem to change with a software update and I am starting from square zero again. Very inconsistent and frustrating.

Please fix performance. I don’t want to end up having to reinstall every week, losing the data, just to have it less sluggish.

Other than that i’d say the concept works! Placebo or not but i really feel that i can control the ball better and better, and feeling better also, especially after a good session</div>

PLEASE. Obviously, new practice games.  An API for devs. 

I LOVE MY MENDI

Does It Work? You betcha. Best meditations of my life. You so won’t be sorry if you buy a Mendi. 

If used regularly, you will wonder how you ever lived without this tool. I almost purchased a different kind of BCI. I chose MENDI (Best decision). In time, I’m sure I will try other products but I’m confident MENDI will always be my go to for my main practice. I suffer from ADHD and severe anxiety which means the typical medications. Been on them for years yet I’ve never felt as good as I do right now. 
I Love My MENDI

In February, the one preceding the original March pandemic madness, I lost my mother to cancer. She was my mom, rock, and she was my best friend too. I’m 41 now and have not had a job for 15 years or drove a car in who knows. Up to last year I had never lived alone. I’d never lived outside of the house I grew up in. My entire life has been fighting my mental health issues. Now  I’m a child trying to learn how to live like an adult. It isn’t easy. I have practiced a lot over the years but never long-term habit before. I look forward to time using MEMDI Then I met MENDI.

 I LOVE MY MENDI. 

I thank everyone at MENDI for this product. I don’t know how I could ever express my gratitude. You guys saved my life. Anything I can do to help
you guys, I’d be honored. I’d be happy to take part in any beta testing, clinical studies, research studies, learning paths, whatever it be.

                <div class="review-text">Mendi is a game changer to be sure, but the app is disappointingly limited. Maximum session duration is arbitrarily 15 minutes. I am using Mendi to augment my meditation practice and 15 minutes is a short sit for me. Explanations for how the exercise works are lacking substance - neurofeedback is backed by solid science, but the instructions for how to do it in the app are all a bit fluffy. A “rating” option would also be good for when taking notes. These are my first impressions after a week. Looking forward to future improvements so I can give a 5 star rating!</div>

                <div class="review-text">My Mendi was delivered on Wednesday, July 7, 2021. Arrived it perfect condition, well packaged, beautifully made, and was a snap to setup. It took seconds for it to locate and connect with the free app. In fact, it took longer to download the app than it took to setup and begin using.  Entire process is incredibly intuitive. Having only been three days, it’s too soon to boast about any improvements, but I am certain I am feeling something going on in my head. Having read about the benefits of neuro-feedback in the book, “The Body Keeps The Score,” by Bessel Van der Kolk MD, I am excited by the possibilities of the benefits of consistent daily practice with Mendi. I have high hopes for this device and its training.</div>

I have to restart the app after completing the initial breathing exercise over half the time. Also, what is the reasoning of having us find a rest and complete a breathing exercise in forced portrait mode prior to taking a baseline of prefrontal activation, then requiring us to physically rotate the screen immediately prior to the measurement?

Please make it a ping sound that happens only ONE time when milestones during session are reached (every new 10% increase: ex 20-30% in blood flow a bell sound would ring.)This would help immensely in improving the session.I've had to ask people to mention when I reach a new increment (eyes closed sessions)and the results are much improved(50%+ improvement)</div>

It takes a measument of this at the start of every session when calibrating but it won't show you this reading, so you have no idea if it is helping or not.</div>

Should be able to change sounds, change rolling ball, change colors, might be nice to see historical, might be nice to have coaching options. In setting up a session, it seems like there could be more options for biofeedback, would be great to change the graphic from rolling to controlling object like shrink grow, or balancing, or run in background audio.

After 2 years, still having no control over the ball apparently raises my heart rate and stress levels through pure annoyance and constantly feeling like I am failing at something that is clearly just not possible. On the plus side, now that I know this, I have found a new way to use it. I do like the music, so I now shut off the sound effects, let the music play, close my eyes and meditate.</div>

I'm literally only on my fourth day of training and I've already set my baseline and I am seeing and starting to understand how this works. Plus, there are some fantastic psychiatrists on YouTube who dedicate their lives strictly to testing and using these types of devices and their notes and tests are extremely helpful.

                <div class="review-text">The app has several issues. It's flaky. It works after a clean start, but it's crashes after a while. Trying to take more than one training session doesn't work. It just hangs. The videos doesn't work either. They start playing and stops just after a few seconds. Clearing cache and re-instaling the app doesn't solve the issue. I would not buy or recommend the device given the poor quality of the app.</div>

On average most days are more focussed, mood is more level and I feel more able to use reasoning more than reacting. If I want to focus on a thing, I can, far more than before. The effects are subtle and build over weeks, please note. I would like an unlimited time option PLEASE!!</div>

When I add emotions, they don't seem to appear in the session record. *Edit - actually it does appear, but only once one has done a session after that initial session. Like n+1 Also, if I do a session, and try to do one immediately afterwards, after calibrating, I see the pink screen and nothing else happens. Have to force close the app to be able to get out of this and successfully Day 3 wow! It's finally starting to click! This is amazing!</div>

I tried to use automate to fix some problems but it seems impossible to correctly detect if the app is running in game mode. Notifications popup when the game is running, if auto brightness is on in dark environements, brightness pumps depending on the game background which distracts, if you change from user to guest, no other setting changes are used. support is nice</div>

The music is very soothing + enlivening (2 options - the one I use is more like planetarium music). I'm so glad that it works in airplane mode, since I do my daily session before I connect my phone in the morning. Would like some kind of bell/ding noise when the session is complete so I can do it without music with my eyes closed.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Such a fun experience, and hopefully great training. I'm only a few days into my journey but there are a few things I can see that need attention on the app. The first thing is change is when coming out of a season I would like to see that sessions stats (makes sense right?), but no it shows me my best sessions stats for that day with no apparent way to look at a specific session. Second is making the guest feature more apparent and easy to use. Finally, more "games"!!</div>

E.g., one day, your brain activity is higher and concentration prolonged, and you get a lower "rating" then when you hit 100 seconds of concentration. There's no explanation as to why nor individualized progress tips. Just the generic fluff blog articles. Support is nice but ultimately not really helpful enough to understand how you can improve because it's just general advice. New features are not visible in the app.</div>

It occasionally asks if I'm in sunlight or moving when I'm still and using it normally. A suggestion to encourage engagement would be to have some activity stats of the collective user base, eg. X% of users that are currently on a 10,15,30 day streak, and when you unlock an achievement it includes a % of how many users have achieved it.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Great piece of hardware and a great app! I've definitely noticed an improvement from using it! Just one request. Is at all possible to realase a SDK? For people to use personally, not for commercial development. It would be nice to code something I could use on my laptop for instance. The only really minor complaint I would have about the app is the background music sounds like funeral home music. Other than that it's really pretty awesome. 👍</div>

They responded on the 16th telling me they would send a replacement in under 2 weeks... this seems like an excessive amount of time to have to wait for a working product.

Even so I'm getting immediate results, my head feels a lot clearer and calmer throughout the day. Thank you for finally getting there! I do have two wishes: can you make this app more workable on other mobile devices pleaseeee and second, more soundtracks :)</div>

The only issues I have are minor and I think very specific; I have a Jelly 2 as my main phone, which is a smaller than usual android phone, and certain apps for some reason don't calibrate the screen correctly. In any case using a bigger (or normal, rather) screen with Mendi feels right. Great job on the app!</div>

I have used the mendi at least once every single day after receiving it. At first I was a frustrated because I was getting mixed results. I stuck with it, and kept going. After a few weeks I started getting in the zone. And I have seen and felt massive improvements in focus, emotional awareness and cognitive clarity.
The staff responds quickly and are courteous. Robert was receptive to my request and mentioned that he would pass it along to the correct department. This is a great product it has helped me with my meditation. I believe this will elevate me and anyone willing to stick with it, to the next level. Thank you Mendi team. I am looking forward to more positive options when describing the feelings. Positive people live healthier lives!</div>

                <div class="review-text">I have been using the Mendi device for about 2.5 years now, and I have to say—it is truly impressive! I first discovered Mendi as a backer on Kickstarter, intrigued by the idea of making neurofeedback training accessible for home use. Since incorporating it into my routine, I’ve noticed significant improvements in my focus and cognitive endurance. The real-time feedback feature is especially valuable, providing clear guidance on optimizing training for better results. Additionally, the gamified approach keeps sessions engaging, making it an effective and enjoyable tool.

I’m excited to continue using Mendi to further enhance my focus and mental well-being. My coworkers at the hospital have also taken a keen interest in it. In such a high-stress environment, they appreciate how easy it is to use and how it helps them feel more focused and relaxed. The real-time neurofeedback and interactive training make it both engaging and effective, and many of them are already noticing improvements in their concentration and mental clarity. It’s become a fun yet valuable tool during our breaks.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Excellent product. Be warned, this takes persistance in the first three to four weeks. Benefits are slowly accumulated, there's no "placebo" hit at all and you'd be forgiven for thinking nothing is happening. Trawl the Facebook group and videos for tips to help.

Effects, for me: after use, all day focus in a complex job, mood uplift, greater fluency when writing.

Don'r focus on scores as long as you, on average, make the score higher at the end than at the start. It is NOT like a game where you get better over time giving higher scores, not the percentage ones at least. Even my poor score days give me the benefits I'm after.

                <div class="review-text">Update: After consideration, I'm adding 2 stars. The product is still 1 star in my book, but I think the company is generally trying to do good business, they are just really bad at it, in my opinion.

Update: I still regret this purchase and the whole rigermarole of return has been a joke. That said, the company did contact me and I did get the full refund. The shipping label cost was not deducted, so they did pay the return shipping, which is a big deal. It is confusing because they say you are responsible for shipping costs in some parts so it was unclear, but they did cover the cost. They also asked that I clarify that customer service did respond to inquiries for return, which is true, however, I stand by my statement that I emailed someone outside CS (who had sent an email after my order) when it was over a week late, and I received no response. I still can't recommend the product or company. But in mind they went from a -3 to a 1 star for at least responding to my concerns and getting my refund processed.

Original: I deeply regret buying this. It didn't work as advertised (small example, the ball actually goes higher almost everyone every time some one starts taking to the user, distracting them, supposedly indication of better focus). The app was glitchy and didn't work correctly (or completely froze) half the time. It came late so wasn't on time for a Christmas present and I got no response from the company. Returning in the 30 day period is insanely difficult, customer non responsive, and then, salt in the wound, I have to pay to ship it Estonia which will be extremely expensive. I suspect the positive reviews are all fakes. Buyer beware!!</div>

I am guessing the company paid a lot for suspect reviews.
How it can detect brainwaves is a complete mystery, the red light is certainly not a sensor it works without being placed on the head and just laid on a table.
Maybe this should be aimed at young children as opposed to people who wish to improve their focus and sleep.
4 different people in my family tested this device and guess what we all achieved a score of 62% focus, the odds of this happening is impossible!
It is very disappointing that this device is being aimed at people who are ill with symptoms of ADHD & PTSD etc, when in reality it is just a cheap toy. Making money out of sick people is shocking.</div>

Real-time Neuro-Feedback and Brain Training technologies are generally quite expensive, sometimes even prohibitively so. In this context, Mendi stands out by offering an accessible solution with an excellent price-to-quality ratio, making it the most affordable device of this type that I have encountered so far.

I have been testing the Mendi device for over two months, and the results have been very promising. In my approach, I always start with thorough research, followed by personal testing, and then applying it to larger groups. So far, Mendi has pleasantly surprised me with its ease of use and the consistency of results achieved with regular training.

We live in an era where technology plays a central role in our lives and evolves extremely rapidly, often in ways we do not fully recognize, and sometimes not at all. Real-time Neuro-Feedback and Brain Training devices have already become a less recognized necessity because there are many negative factors in our technological environment that can affect mental and cognitive health. Mendi offers an effective way to train the brain and harness neuroplasticity to counteract these negative influences, similar to how we care about exercise and nutrition to maintain a healthy and fulfilling life.

Another aspect that deeply impressed me was my interaction with the Mendi Team. In a field where communication with manufacturers is often difficult, I was surprised by their warmth, kindness, and extraordinary availability. The Mendi team was incredibly responsive and prompt in addressing all my requests, and this human openness and attention to detail make me appreciate that I have encountered an exceptional, passionate, and dedicated team. This gives me confidence in a beautiful, beneficial, and lasting collaboration. Honestly, when I meet such people, I feel blessed, and I am confident that the future is in good hands.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I’ve used Mendi to help restore memory loss from long COVID and for PTSD and depression.

Before I tried TMS that seemed miraculous in that I felt like I was waking up but had another covid infection that took me back to pre TMS status. My husband and I both did another 7week, 5 days week TMS round about a year later and gained nothing from it. TMS was also very expensive even with insurance.

Saw a piece on the Mendi unit on TV used on a child for ADHD and how well it worked for him and he’s now off ADHD meds. Mendi also states it helps heal
The damaged neuropathways same as TMS. I researched online on several different sites for neuro feedback and found it was also in trials for PTSD and depression so my husband bought one (we can both use it). The app is free.

I have noticed a marked improvement in memory, both recall and long term memory issues. I’m calmer and can handle situations that would normally stress me out in a more rational way. My depression issues have improved but not disappeared. When I sleep, it’s deeper and more refreshing.

As an avid reader, Covid took my ability to concentrate and read a book without going over the last 10-20 pages several times so I just quit trying. After using Mendi for about a month I gave reading another try and finished an entire book without having to reread anything and still remember what I read even after 2 months! I’m also a musician (I play at it) and an aspiring artist but have had no desire to engage at all. I’m starting to feel like I want to get back into both.

I’ve been using Mendi every day, sometime twice a day for 75 days as of August 24, 2024. I will continue to use it daily as a boost for my brain health.

It’s been worth the experiment for me!</div>

The music and graphics are wonderfully done. The linking articles are interesting and well worth reading.
The device is well packaged and easy to operate.

One morning while operating the device, I could sense beautiful energy beings in my space and my brain activity soured. I got the "crown" and high score. This was proof for me that the device can work. I'm guessing, everyone must be different in their experiences.</div>

I experienced some trouble with my mendi device. I was a little cynical expecting them to run me through a complicated refurbishment and application process like majority of companies. They did ask me some questions to see what the problem was,but after that it was very easy to get the problem fixed. They responded quickly, acted quickly, and the process was simple.

                <div class="review-text">My review is about how, unfortunately, the product does not work.
I know it's a disappointment.
I will say it DOES work in the sense it gets you to try and practice focusing, which I guess IS the objective, even if the matter in which they're doing it is false.

So with the Mendi headset the way to manipulate you score is scrunch your brow (like when mad) OR looking up vs down at any given time (you don't need to shake your head).
Whenever you look up your score will be low... whenever you look down your score will be sky high.

I think what this device measures IS blood flow to your brain (frontal cortex), BUT how much you lean forward is how much "blood" is there.

Picturing being hung upside down.. you can really feel where the blood is going to your head (and probably Mendi would tell you you're brain capacity is beyond 100%).

Lastly, your score for how you're improving factors heavily into how OFTEN you use it (your streak and what day you are on). So, are you REALLY getting better just because you're using it more often?
I'd argue someone with a great score, using a new account, would have a bad score because the game is just rewarding you being disciplined and showing up.

I am sorry to be the one to let you down.
I wish I could post a picture showing you my findings but Trust Pilot does not offer this feature.

Some positives is the music is good, visuals are good, concept it GREAT.

It's good training for your brain. However, there seems to be a bug with android devices where the sessions aren't being logged properly. If not for that issue, I'd give them 4 or 5 stars since it's a good experience. But as of right now, I can't give them higher than 2 stars since not being able to log your sessions defeats a lot of the purpose with the training.

Edit 2023-12-18: The issue seems to have been resolved on the beta version of the app which I'm using, and they have also been regularly updating other bugs that are occurring. But I'm still not sure if the bug has been resolved on the public version of the app. But since it's no longer affecting me and my personal experience, I will change it to 4 stars. I think for me to give it 5 stars, I'd like to see some more variety on games as opposed to just having a single game to play.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Mendi is a wonderfully helpful tool to enhance focus, and a number of other mental functions and skills. As with any improvement, consistent practice is critical. Once you get into the routine of spending even a daily 5 minutes using the Mendi, the results do begin to show up. No doubt, they are a little different for each person, but reading the comments from others, and comparing that to my own experience, one of the key benefits is greater ease and quality in one's focus. That by itself has lots of "spill over" benefits to other parts of your life. Also, I have found the Mendi team to be very customer focused. Keep enhancing this excellent tool!</div>

It drew me in, but I also muscle tested myself for it, and I considered many other products out there. After 8 days of Mendi utilization, I can feel the changes in my brain -- better focus, better breathing, better life.

I've only begun to experience the benefits, yet if I experienced no more, it was worth the relatively small cost. It'll be worth more and more as I go, so if you're considering buying it, just do it!

Whether you have done traditional neurofeedback or not, this is a pivotal tool. You can do it daily (or even multiple times a day), and you can experiment with variables (supplementation, meditation practices, time of day usage, etc) too maximize the effectiveness of the sessions. This is hard to do when you're going to a center/storefront for neurofeedback. It doesn't replace it, but it's a wonderful tool.</div>

                <div class="review-text">The gadget is very effective yet simple to set up and use right away. More importantly, the after-sales support from the communication and community team is fantastic. Robert Rtveliashvili took time to patiently explain in detail the best way to use Mendi and also recommended useful resources for further exploration. Mendi is a winner not just because its a great product but there are also great people behind it - in creating the product and being with the users after its sold.</div>

I’ve been using Mendi for a week and I already can feel the difference on my ability to concentrate, stress relief and better mood. It’s incredible how it can just turn a stressful mind/mood into a better mood and light head in 15 minutes . I love it!</div>

Neuroplasticity is possible with Mendi because you get instant biofeedback with the Mendi device and the app. Easy to use and happy to have Mendi in my life.

I strongly recommend daily usage and experimenting with times and the length of training in order to find the best solution for yourself.
My training routine is 15 min every morning within 30 min of being awake and before coffee.

                <div class="review-text">The good stuff:
Mendi is a nicely design product, and the whole ecommerce experienced worked very well. The app in itself is pretty nice, and the "game" is very well designed which makes it kind of fun to play.

My doubts:
I was quite invested in trying out the product but I couldn't help but wondering if it actually has any effect. It says in the app that you should experience some effect after 6-8 weeks. I used the product 3-5 times per week for 11 consecutive weeks but I can't say that I experienced any effect. It does measure something, that much I can say, but I'm not sure that the "exercise" actually has any effect. I did become better at the game in the first weeks, but then it pretty quickly levelled out, and I didn't experience any other effect. If the device didn't break down (more in next paragraph) I would probably keep using it for a while longer to see if there would be any effect, but at this point in time I would not recommend it to a friend.

The bad stuff:
It loses connection quite a lot which is a bit annoying. It seemed to get worse over time.
What's worse, after 11 weeks, it stopped charging and is now completely dead. It has amazing battery time, so it was actually only the third or fourth time I charged it. I find this disappointing in terms of quality.

So all in all, a nice device that probably doesn't do anything, and even if it does, its quality is fair below par. Don't buy it! Instead, use the 10 minutes per day to meditate for free - you will have a much better effect.</div>

                <div class="review-text">The app is poorly thought out. I've had mendi for two years and it's gotten worse. Nothing has improved. There are no new paths, just the usual ball rolling with the same music. If you want to consult the diary, the journal numbers overlap the words. The outline is obnoxious, resulting in a chaotic page with information that overlaps each other. Only the learning section is very accurate. Personally, after 6 months of use, I could only see a plateau in the device's effectiveness. Better than nothing, but it is not miraculous.</div>

I can stand by mendi 100% after a few days of using it I can feel different parts of my brain (specifically left prefrontal cortex at this stage). And im learning how to concentrate - I can feel my brain processing or learning and trying while its happening. In the app I indicated my mood felt better after a few sessions and looking up part of the brain region and it has to do with positive emotions. And something in my brain clicked and I just felt better and thought much lighter of a situation that was drama free.

I compared them across several devices and they have cognitive Enhancement via focusing and other brain health benefits. Won't go for muse, returned apollo, it just vibrates will also get omniperf because it sends frequencies. And 100% keep mendi!

It also has a guest feature so I was sharing it with my brother.

Cons
- customer service didn't get back to me on an inquiry before I bought it.
- duty fees to Canada was $50 or $75 but I read reviews and was prepared for it.

Advice use paypal in case you need help with your order otherwise the device will arrive with duty fees to pay and its worth it!

P.s. this review was not invited. Their CRM is not updated yet after buying I got an email with a discount to purchase it.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Note that I ordered the product from the US and had no need to try to return it so did not run into any of those issues. I have had the product right at a year, initially a few times a week and lately nearly every day (skip on Sundays a lot!). Initially I noticed improved creativity early on and that my mind was quieter - less cluttered. I later noticed after continued use I had vastly improved metacognition (thoughts about thoughts, essentially realizing what I am thinking at any given moment). This led to a recent breakthrough and subsequent newfound insight into long-term issues with anxiety that was leading to emotional thinking and reactivity as opposed to rational response in any given situation, especially one that was novel or anxiety provoking. I can now take any internal emotional "temperature" at any given moment (and remembering to do so!) and retain a state of calm with profoundly greater consistency.

Also for the first time I have been able to read rapidly without internal pronunciation of words. This was just discovered since I had fallen out of the habit of reading novels until just starting a course through work.

I have deep gratitude for what Mendi has done for me and how it has improved my quality of life.</div>

                <div class="review-text">I am not sure about the actual device but my experience has not been positive
I got a demanding letter from FedEx saying they wanted £46.00 for delivery
I was shocked as Mendi say delivery is free
It turns out this charge is correct and somewhere there is something that tells you this. It would be more honest if they made it clear about this extra charge ( then I would not have ordered it).Customer service offered a partial refund of less than half of this but I am not happy. Not exactly free delivery in fact not at all free delivery</div>

                <div class="review-text">I cannot get a reply from this company! I’ve emailed the only email they have shown, at least 8 times in the last two weeks and still no reply. I am excited to try this Mendi device but I need to return this one I just received, as it is somewhat lopsided and doesn’t fit snug on one side of the forehead. I ordered another one- in hopes it will be symmetrical. But I need to return this and I’ve been trying to get ahold of them for almost two weeks and soon it will be past the 30 day return period!!!!!!</div>

                <div class="review-text">Biofeedback such as Mendi have evolved much thanks to better sensors. Unfortunately what programmers often forget is the user friendly aspect of a device. I have used other devices before Mendi and their worst feature was that the developer is often more concerned about collecting data for his company than provide the user with a friendly app. How can one concentrate or meditate if we are frustrated by that device? For a user like myself this is why I am now exclusively using Mendi and looking forward to my daily session. By user friendly I mean firstly the ease to connect, and more important, the ability to restart if we are not comfortable during calibration. Secondly if you decide to redo a session, the Mendi app will keep the best session. Last but not least the ease to contact a real person for support is very important. Users may take these features for granted but that it is not the case. These are the features that allow me to be relaxed when starting a gainful daily session with Mendi. I will recommend Mendi over any similar devices.
May I also suggest a fancy box for Mendi users?
A warm thank you to all the staff for a true masterpiece.</div>

I do feel more focused and relaxed, but sometimes the App logs you out and I need to restart my phone in order to log-in again, otherwise it stays as guest. Also need more stability, sometimes when playing the game, the ball starts going up and down very fast, and yes, I do follow the instructions (no direct light, do not disturb mode, etc.). But overall experience, is really good, it did change my habits for good.</div>

                <div class="review-text">Great device for shaping the only tool you really have in life, your brain. I have used Mendi for well over a month now and I can say that once you pass the initial learning curve there are definitive benefits to this, I feel more relaxed and focused and seem to have better impulse control. It’s very similar to mindfulness where you focus on your breath for example, except you can see in real time if you are doing it right. The app is not perfect but the team behind it are often updating with new features and fixes.</div>
