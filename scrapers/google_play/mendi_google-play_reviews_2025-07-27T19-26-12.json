Should be able to change sounds, change rolling ball, change colors, might be nice to see historical, might be nice to have coaching options. In setting up a session, it seems like there could be more options for biofeedback, would be great to change the graphic from rolling to controlling object like shrink grow, or balancing, or run in background audio. Good 4 now!",

After 2 years, still having no control over the ball apparently raises my heart rate and stress levels through pure annoyance and constantly feeling like I am failing at something that is clearly just not possible. On the plus side, now that I know this, I have found a new way to use it. I do like the music, so I now shut off the sound effects, let the music play, close my eyes and meditate.",

    "review": "Lovely app. I feel the start session button should be moved to the top of the training page. It occasionally asks if I'm in sunlight or moving when I'm still and using it normally. A suggestion to encourage engagement would be to have some activity stats of the collective user base, eg. X% of users that are currently on a 10,15,30 day streak, and when you unlock an achievement it includes a % of how many users have achieved it.",

I'm simply amazed how well this thing works, even with the app not optimized for my Lenovo tablet (at least according to Google play) and connection to the Mendi headset at 20% at the very best. Even so I'm getting immediate results, my head feels a lot clearer and calmer throughout the day. Thank you for finally getting there! I do have two wishes: can you make this app more workable on other mobile devices pleaseeee and second, more soundtracks :)",

The only issues I have are minor and I think very specific; I have a Jelly 2 as my main phone, which is a smaller than usual android phone, and certain apps for some reason don't calibrate the screen correctly. In any case using a bigger (or normal, rather) screen with Mendi feels right. Great job on the app!",
